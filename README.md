# Mapper

### Object to object mapper in Typescript

**Inspired by [Automapper](https://github.com/automapper/automapper)**

This library provides an API to map an object into another object, following previously set rules.  
It is designed with redux's reducers in mind, so it is a perfect fit when used as application's state incremental modifier.

Supports:
+ ~~Immutability~~
+ ~~Nested mapping~~
+ Redudant mapping
+ Denormalization helpers
+ ~~Override of pre-existing rules to behave differently in runtime (edge cases)~~
+ ~~Array mapping~~
